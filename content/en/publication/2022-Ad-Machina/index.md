abstract: "Organizations have always been marked by new global trends, such as geopolitical changes, trade exchanges and evolutions in business models. Life with the pandemic, since March 2020, is also considered exceptional. This study is a continuation of an initial survey published at the beginning of the crisis. It aims to provide food for thought for reflections on the positive adaptation strategies that are maintained or thatresult from the health crisis associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of the previous publication was to identify the positive effects perceived or resulting from the health crisis, to better understand how the various actors in society are organizing or mobilizing in face of such a disaster. With the same objective, this reflection assesses to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic would have, two years later, prompted people to implement new coping strategies in addition to identifying how they anticipate returning to work or normality. More specifically, this article provides the results of the information collected from 110respondents. These results indicate that workers continue to adapt positively, but that certain resources must be introduced to ensure and even strengthen their resilience capacity. To sustain their leadership after the pandemic, our leaders and managers will have to consider the factors that favour developing or maintaining resilience. They will also have to exercise leadership marked by benevolent management practices, and implement clever systems adapted to the context in which society and the work environment are evolving at the end of this crisis."
